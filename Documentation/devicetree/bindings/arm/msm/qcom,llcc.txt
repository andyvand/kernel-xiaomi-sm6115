== Introduction==

LLCC (Last Level Cache Controller) provides last level of cache memory in SOC,
that can be shared by multiple clients. Clients here are different cores in the
SOC, the idea is to minimize the local caches at the clients and migrate to
common pool of memory. Cache memory is divided into partitions called slices
which are assigned to clients. Clients can query the slice details, activate
and deactivate them.

Properties:
- compatible:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <string>
	Definition: must be "qcom,sdm845-llcc"

- reg:
	Usage: required
	Value Type: <prop-encoded-array>
	Definition: Start address and the the size of the register region.

- cap-based-alloc-and-pwr-collapse:
	Usage: optional
	Value Type: Boolean
	Definition: Property to express that HLOS can enable/disable capacity
	based allocation and power collapse retention for a client. Include
	this property to set it. If not set, it will be treated as false.

Example:

	cache-controller@1100000 {
		compatible = "qcom,sdm845-llcc";
		reg = <0x1100000 0x250000>;
	};
