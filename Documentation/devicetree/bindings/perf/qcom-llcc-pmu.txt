* QCOM LLCC PMU Bindings

This represents the miss counters located in the LLCC hardware counters.
Only one event is supported:

The follow section describes the LLCC PMU DT node binding.

Required properties:
- compatible		: Shall be "qcom,qcom-llcc-pmu"
- reg			: There shall be two resources, each a pair of the form
			  < base_address total_size >.  One will represent the
			  DDR LAGG region, the other will represent the LLCC
			  BEAC region.
- reg-names		: There shall be two values, one 'lagg-base', one
			  'beac-base', corresponding to the order of the two
			  'reg' values.

Example:
	llcc_pmu: llcc-pmu {
		compatible = "qcom,qcom-llcc-pmu";
		reg = < 0x090CC000 0x300 >, < 0x09648000 0x110 >;
		reg-names = "lagg-base", "beac-base";
	};
