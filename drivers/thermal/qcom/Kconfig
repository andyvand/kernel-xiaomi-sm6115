config QCOM_TSENS
	tristate "Qualcomm TSENS Temperature Alarm"
	depends on THERMAL
	depends on QCOM_QFPROM
	depends on ARCH_QCOM || COMPILE_TEST
	help
	  This enables the thermal sysfs driver for the TSENS device. It shows
	  up in Sysfs as a thermal zone with multiple trip points. Disabling the
	  thermal zone device via the mode file results in disabling the sensor.
	  Also able to set threshold temperature for both hot and cold and update
	  when a threshold is reached.

config QTI_VIRTUAL_SENSOR
	bool "QTI Virtual Sensor driver"
	depends on THERMAL_OF
	help
	  This driver has the information about the virtual sensors used by
	  QTI chipset's and registers the virtual sensors to a thermal zone.
	  The virtual sensor information includes the underlying thermal
	  sensors to query for temperature and the aggregation logic to
	  determine the virtual sensor temperature.

config QTI_BCL_PMIC5
	bool "BCL driver for BCL peripherals in PMIC5"
	depends on SPMI && THERMAL_OF
	help
	  Say Y here to enable this BCL driver for PMIC5. This driver
	  provides routines to configure and monitor the BCL
	  PMIC peripheral. This driver registers the battery current and
	  voltage sensors with the thermal core framework and can take
	  threshold input and notify the thermal core when the threshold is
	  reached.

config QTI_BCL_SOC_DRIVER
	bool "QTI Battery state of charge sensor driver"
	depends on THERMAL_OF
	help
	  This driver registers battery state of charge as a sensor with
	  thermal zone. This sensor can monitor for state of charge
	  threshold and notify the thermal framework.

	  If you want this support, you should say Y here.
